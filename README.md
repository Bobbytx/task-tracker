# Task Tracker

I’m rebooting my coding routine with a small but useful task tracker. It’s a simple command-line app right now, and I’ll keep layering on new features as I stretch my skills again.

## Features

- Add tasks quickly from the prompt.
- View pending tasks in a numbered list.
- Mark tasks as complete and review what’s done.
- Friendly, consistent in-terminal messaging.
